# covid_19_Random_Python_Code
This is not an actual documentation of the code but it is just a documentation of my findings on some features 
I have discovered with Python.
Python lacks a direct suport or feauture of arrays and instead relies more on lists unliike other languages such as Ruby or Java that have inbuilt capabilities to work with arrays.
Therefore, while working with an array in Java may be something like this my_array= [10,20,30], this is not the same thing in Python as this is a list in Python.
To work with Python arrays, I have to first import everything from the array module in this manner: import array *
The syntax for an array here would then look like this: my_array_name = array ( 'i', [10,20,30]). The i in this instance is the type which is a signed int
